## Paper 1: Thom (2016) - Motion Picture Incentive Programs

### Summary

In Lights, Camera, but No Action? (2016), Michael Thom evaluates whether state motion picture incentive (MPI) programs achieve their stated goals of fostering economic development. He constructs a panel dataset covering all 50 states from the late 1990s through 2013 and applies fixed-effects regression models to compare states with and without film incentive programs. Effectiveness is benchmarked against outcomes such as motion picture industry employment, wages, number of establishments, and states’ share of national film industry output. Thom finds that film incentives fail to produce sustained growth in jobs, wages, or business establishments; the only discernible effects are short-term wage gains for workers already employed in the industry. Furthermore, states with film credits did not expand their share of national film industry activity over time, suggesting that subsidies merely shuffle productions across states rather than create new capacity. Overall, Thom concludes that film tax credits are a poor economic development strategy, delivering at best transitory benefits and at worst imposing substantial costs with little return.

### Relationship to My Research

Yet, at the same time, Thom's analysis leaves several important questions open that inspire the direction of my own research. His nationwide scope is a strength for breadth but comes at the cost of depth, particularly for the states most identified with film production incentives: Georgia and California. Moreover, his study stops in 2013, meaning it cannot speak to the large and politically salient program expansions that occurred afterward, most notably California's 2015 and 2020 reforms. Finally, Thom critiques efficiency in broad terms but does not engage in detailed benchmarking of film tax credits against other policy alternatives—a gap that matters because state budgets are finite, and evaluating subsidies requires not only knowing whether they "work" but also whether they are the best use of funds compared to other programs.

### How My Research Builds Upon This Work

Building on this foundation, my project adopts a two-pronged strategy that both complements and extends Thom's work:

**Georgia Focus - Efficiency Analysis:**
On one front, I focus on Georgia to sharpen the efficiency critique. Georgia has become the poster child of film tax credit programs, offering some of the nation's most generous incentives and branding itself as the "Hollywood of the South." Here, I plan to calculate cost-per-job figures directly from Georgia's audit reports and then benchmark those numbers against people-based subsidies such as state EITC supplements and workforce training initiatives. This exercise moves beyond Thom's aggregate findings to a more concrete policy comparison: if Georgia spends, for instance, $150,000 to create one job through film credits but could create the same job at one-tenth the cost through training or wage supplements, then the inefficiency is not just academic but politically and fiscally significant. This analysis reframes the debate around opportunity cost, making the argument more tangible for policymakers and voters.

**California Focus - Updated Effectiveness Analysis:**
On the other front, I turn to California to revisit the effectiveness question with updated data and a state-specific lens. California's film credit program is distinctive in design—it uses a more targeted allocation system and has undergone two major expansions in 2015 and 2020, both of which fall outside Thom's sample period. By employing a difference-in-differences framework similar to Thom's but extending the dataset through 2022, I can directly test whether these expansions have succeeded in retaining productions, sustaining industry employment, or boosting wages and GDP.

To strengthen causal inference, I plan to supplement the difference-in-differences analysis with a synthetic control design, constructing a weighted “synthetic California” out of other states that did not expand their credits in the same period. This approach allows me to compare California’s actual trajectory to a counterfactual that closely mirrors its pre-treatment trends, minimizing concerns about biased estimates due to idiosyncratic state shocks or divergent baseline dynamics. In addition, I will run a national totals check—verifying that any measured “gains” in California are not merely offset by equivalent losses elsewhere. This step is critical, because Thom’s findings suggest that incentives often shuffle production across states rather than generate net new industry growth. By confirming whether California’s measured increases are genuine or simply zero-sum relative to national totals, I can reduce error and avoid overstating the policy’s effectiveness.

This updated replication is critical not only for capturing California's unique policy trajectory but also for answering the broader question of whether more recent, better-designed credits outperform the earlier generation of subsidies that Thom studied. If California's experience shows only short-term spikes with little long-term effect, even after redesign and expansion, then it strengthens Thom's core argument; but if modest gains are evident, it complicates the narrative and suggests that program design may matter more than previously recognized.

### Research Contribution

Taken together, these two extensions allow me to move beyond the binary "do film credits work?" to a more nuanced set of questions: Are they efficient relative to other uses of state funds? And even when expanded and refined, are they effective at delivering sustained economic outcomes? In this way, Thom's paper does not just provide a conclusion for me to repeat; it serves as a launching pad that inspires a deeper dive into the most consequential state cases and motivates a methodological update that connects his original findings to today's policy landscape.

## Paper 2: Owens & Rennhoff (2023) - Political Economy of Film Tax Credits

### Summary

Owens & Rennhoff (2023) take an important step in shifting the conversation about film tax credits away from purely economic evaluation and toward the political economy that sustains them. Their study, forthcoming in Applied Economics, analyzes roll-call votes by state legislators on film production incentive bills. Using data on voting patterns, party affiliation, electoral margins, unemployment rates, and neighboring state policies, they test what predicts support for these subsidies. The central finding is striking: legislators' votes are not explained by objective economic conditions such as existing levels of film production in their district or even by campaign contributions from the film industry. Instead, they are strongly shaped by political incentives—for example, whether neighboring states had already adopted incentives (suggesting competitive pressure), whether legislators faced tight re-election margins (suggesting a desire for visible "job creation wins"), and their party identity.

### Relationship to My Research

This paper matters for my research because it provides quantitative backing for an argument that Thom (2016) only raised qualitatively—that film tax credits persist for reasons beyond their economic logic. Where Thom observed entrenchment and reluctance to repeal once money was sunk, Owens & Rennhoff show, with voting data, that legislators support credits even in the absence of clear local economic benefit because of political calculus. They also find that districts whose legislators supported credits later saw modest upticks in film production, meaning politicians could plausibly claim credit for "bringing jobs home," even if the broader economic effects were negligible.

### How My Research Builds Upon This Work

I build on this study by shifting the focus from legislative voting behavior to the timing of program expansions, specifically in Georgia and California. Owens & Rennhoff show who votes for credits and why, but they do not examine whether credit expansions are deliberately aligned with election cycles. My research extends their framework by mapping the introduction and expansion of major state programs (e.g., Georgia's 2008 enactment and subsequent growth, California's 2015 and 2020 expansions) against gubernatorial election calendars to test whether expansions are strategically timed for electoral advantage. In doing so, I complement their finding that political pressures explain legislative support with a new angle: that political timing may explain why expansions occur when they do, regardless of economic evidence.

In sum, Owens & Rennhoff (2023) help me transition from the economic critique of film credits (à la Thom) to the political economy critique. Their results give me confidence to argue that the persistence and growth of these programs cannot be explained by efficiency or effectiveness alone. By extending their work to electoral timing in Georgia and California, I situate my research at the intersection of economics and politics, showing how subsidies survive despite weak returns because they serve political goals.

## Rationale for Paper Selection

While I anchor my project in Thom (2016) and Owens & Rennhoff (2023), I also examined other important contributions to the literature. Bradbury (2020) focuses on the return on investment of film tax credits, showing that states often recoup only a fraction of what they spend, sometimes as little as 27 cents per dollar. Button (2019) uses a difference-in-differences framework to test whether credits shift production activity, finding small bumps in TV filming but no meaningful employment or wage effects. Owens & Rennhoff (2018) take a discrete-choice approach to location decisions and conclude that credits may attract productions in the short term but fail to establish permanent clusters. Each of these studies reinforces the picture that film incentives are costly and limited in impact, but they largely build on the same efficiency/effectiveness critique that Thom already established. 

What they do not address in depth are the comparative efficiency tradeoffs (film credits vs. people-based subsidies) or the political incentives driving expansions, which are central to my project. By contrast, Thom provides the broad empirical foundation on ineffectiveness, and Owens & Rennhoff (2023) uniquely extend the conversation into the political domain. Taken together, these two papers give me both the economic baseline and the political framework to develop my two-pronged analysis of Georgia and California, while the other works serve as valuable background confirmation rather than core inspiration.
