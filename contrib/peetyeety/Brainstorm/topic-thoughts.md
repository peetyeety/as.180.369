# Economic Paper Topics

**Hi Professor,**

I'm currently split between two research topics. I would like your insights and advice on which one to proceed with:

## Film Tax Credits

Film and television tax credits have become a central tool of state and national governments seeking to attract production. My initial thought is that while these programs clearly bring projects into jurisdictions like Georgia, New Mexico, or Ireland, the deeper economic question is whether they truly create new economic activity or simply shift productions that would have happened elsewhere. This relates to core public finance debates about subsidies, efficiency, and "race to the bottom" competition. My hypothesis is that while states with generous tax credits do see measurable boosts in local production counts and spending, much of this activity is relocational rather than additive, raising concerns about whether taxpayer funds are being used efficiently.

To explore this question, I would examine state-level variations in tax credit policies alongside production activity data. The analysis would compare states with different incentive structures to assess whether generous credits correlate with increased production activity or merely relocate existing projects. Key data sources would include state film offices and industry reports. The methodology would involve comparing economic outcomes across states and time periods, focusing on measures of both effectiveness and efficiency to determine whether these programs create genuine economic value or simply redistribute existing activity.

## Ad-Supported Streaming Tiers

Streaming platforms such as Netflix, Disney+, and Warner Bros. Discovery have recently launched ad-supported subscription tiers as a way to reach more price-sensitive consumers. My initial thought is that these tiers are a textbook case of second-degree price discrimination: offering differentiated products to segment the market by willingness-to-pay. The key economic question is whether ad-supported tiers expand the subscriber base by attracting new customers, or whether they cannibalize higher-paying premium subscribers and reduce overall average revenue per user (ARPU). My hypothesis is that ad tiers do lead to market expansion, especially in price-sensitive demographics, but they may also put downward pressure on ARPU in the short run.

To investigate this, I would analyze streaming platform financial data and consumer behavior patterns around the introduction of ad-supported tiers. The research would examine revenue trends, subscriber growth, and market segmentation before and after these launches. Data sources would include company earnings reports and consumer surveys on viewing preferences and price sensitivity. The approach would involve tracking key performance metrics over time to assess whether ad tiers successfully expand market reach or primarily cannibalize existing premium subscriptions. This analysis would connect empirical findings to price discrimination theory to evaluate the overall welfare and revenue effects of this pricing strategy.
