# Literature Review

The academic literature on state film tax credits presents a persistent paradox: despite minimal evidence of sustained economic gains, these programs continue to expand. This review synthesizes four key works that define the current state of knowledge and inform the structure of my study: Thom (2018), Rickman and Wang (2020), Bradbury (2020), and Owens and Rennhoff (2024). Collectively, these works identify two major gaps—temporal (most data end before California's 2015 expansion) and methodological (distinguishing real employment growth from statistical artifacts)—that my research directly addresses.

## 1. Thom (2018): "Lights, Camera, but No Action?"

Thom's (2018) study remains the most comprehensive national analysis of motion picture incentive (MPI) programs. Using a difference-in-differences (DiD) framework on state-level panel data from 1998–2013, Thom evaluates how transferable and refundable credits affect industry employment, wages, gross state product (GSP), and industry concentration (NAICS 512 and 5121). He finds that transferable credits modestly increase employment over time, refundable credits temporarily raise wages, but neither credit type significantly impacts GSP—indicating limited spillovers into broader state economies.

These modest and non-robust results suggest that film incentives often fail to produce durable development outcomes, largely due to program inefficiencies, rent-seeking, and weak accountability. Importantly, Thom's study ends in 2013—just before California's Film and Television Tax Credit 2.0 (AB 1839) was enacted in 2015, which tripled the state's annual cap from $100 million to $330 million.

My study extends Thom's framework both temporally and substantively by analyzing post-2013 data through 2022, encompassing Program 2.0 (2015–2020) and Program 3.0 (2020–2025). Whereas Thom assessed modest pre-2013 programs across all states, I test whether California's larger-scale, modernized credits—amid the rise of streaming platforms—yield stronger employment effects. Thus, my study represents a direct empirical continuation of Thom's work, testing whether his findings persist under larger budgets and a transformed production environment.

## 2. Rickman and Wang (2020): "Lights, Camera, What Action?"

Rickman and Wang (2020) synthesize the nascent empirical literature on U.S. state film incentives and establish methodological standards for credible evaluation. They emphasize that BLS QCEW data for NAICS 512110—motion picture and video production—provides the most consistent measure of sectoral employment. They advocate for Synthetic Control Methods (SCM) to construct valid counterfactuals for treated states and warn that traditional DiD approaches may violate parallel-trends and no-interference (SUTVA) assumptions.

Their meta-analysis finds that while some early-adopter states experienced short-term employment gains, these effects vary widely by program design and industry composition, and they often dissipate over time. They also highlight a key measurement issue: apparent job gains in QCEW data may reflect employee reclassification, temporary project hiring, or cross-state administrative shifts rather than actual growth.

My research adopts Rickman and Wang's methodological guidance by (1) using QCEW NAICS 512110 as the main industry indicator, (2) employing SCM to supplement DiD estimates, and (3) introducing a dual-data validation using ACS migration flows to test whether QCEW employment changes correspond to actual worker relocation. This directly responds to the "reclassification problem" Rickman and Wang identify but leave unresolved.

## 3. Bradbury (2020): "Do State Movie Production Incentives Promote Economic Development?"

Bradbury (2020) shifts the focus from sectoral effects to aggregate state economic outcomes, using instrumental-variable panel models (2000–2015) to test whether film incentives increase state per capita income and gross state product. His results are unequivocally negative: film incentives show no statistically significant effect on aggregate growth, even when industry-level gains exist.

Bradbury's null macro findings highlight the importance of studying within-industry mechanisms to explain why state-level growth fails to materialize. My research embraces this narrower focus—analyzing industry employment and wages, not aggregate GSP—as a way to clarify whether California's modern expansions produce tangible sectoral benefits even if macro outcomes remain flat. Consistent with Bradbury's interpretation, any positive findings in my study should be understood as sectoral reallocations, not statewide development gains.

## 4. Owens and Rennhoff (2024): "Political Behavior and Voting for Tax Incentives"

Owens and Rennhoff (2024) investigate the political determinants behind the persistence of state tax incentives. Through an analysis of legislative roll-call votes across multiple states, they find that party alignment, gubernatorial support, and interstate competition explain the adoption of film tax credits far better than local economic conditions or industry lobbying. Incentives persist not because they are economically effective, but because they provide visible, electorally advantageous wins for policymakers.

Building on this, my study incorporates a descriptive political-timing analysis of California's 2015 and 2020 program enactments relative to gubernatorial election cycles. This supplements the economic analysis by asking whether the timing of policy expansions corresponds to electoral incentives, thereby situating California's behavior within Owens and Rennhoff's broader theory of politically motivated incentive persistence.

## Synthesis and Gaps

Together, these studies create a clear framework for my contribution:

**Temporal gap** – Extending analyses beyond 2013 (Thom) and 2015 (Bradbury) to include California's major 2015 and 2020 expansions.

**Methodological gap** – Resolving the "reclassification vs. relocation" issue identified by Rickman and Wang by incorporating migration evidence from the ACS.

**Contextual gap** – Integrating the political-economy dimension (Owens & Rennhoff) to interpret whether expansion timing reflects policy performance or electoral cycles.

My research thus aligns with the established literature methodologically while offering novel evidence that situates California's modern programs within both economic and political dynamics.
