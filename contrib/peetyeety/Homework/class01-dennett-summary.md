In his article, philosopher Daniel Dennett warns of what he views as one of the most pressing dangers facing society today: the emergence of “counterfeit people” made possible by advances in artificial intelligence (AI). He begins with an analogy to counterfeit currency, which has historically been treated as a grave crime because it erodes trust and undermines economic and social systems. By comparison, Dennett argues that AI systems capable of imitating human behavior pose similar risks to the foundations of democracy and personal freedom. He contends that the very institutions humans struggled to build over centuries could be destabilized if people can no longer reliably distinguish between genuine human interaction and synthetic imitation.

Dennett traces this problem to Alan Turing’s 1950 proposal of the “imitation game,” now commonly referred to as the Turing Test. He suggests that this intellectual framework encouraged researchers to design machines that could deceive humans into believing they were communicating with other humans. According to Dennett, people are naturally inclined to treat any entity that “talks like them” as human, which makes the risks of deception especially significant.

Despite his criticisms, Dennett does not argue against AI in absolute terms. Instead, he offers potential solutions. One proposal is requiring AI systems to disclose themselves openly, perhaps through watermarking technology, similar to how the European Union ensures the authenticity of its currency. Dennett also insists that the individuals and organizations behind these AI systems must be held personally accountable for potential harms. Technical safeguards, however, are not sufficient in his view. He calls for a deeper cultural transformation in which the creation of synthetic “counterfeit people” is regarded as socially irresponsible, even shameful. Without such a shift, Dennett warns, society could descend into a spiral of distrust that undermines democratic governance itself.

From my perspective, Dennett raises important ethical and social concerns, but his outlook is unduly pessimistic. His emphasis on the “intentional stance” rightly highlights how easily humans attribute agency to anything that behaves in a human-like manner. That tendency does create vulnerabilities to deception. Even so, I do not believe it necessarily threatens the survival of civilization. Instead, AI today functions primarily as an assistive tool that enhances everyday processes. For instance, I use AI to generate summaries, take notes, and retrieve information—tasks that meaningfully streamline efficiency. Occasional imperfections in AI-generated text or images do not erase its broader value as a supportive mechanism.

In this light, AI is best understood not as a counterfeit threat but as a general-purpose cognitive instrument, similar in spirit to an advanced calculator with a more intuitive interface. Rather than dismantling human institutions, it extends and amplifies the accumulated knowledge of civilization. History suggests that disruptive innovations—whether the printing press, mass literacy, or the internet—initially provoked alarm but were ultimately integrated into society through adaptation and new norms. AI is likely to follow the same trajectory.

That said, I agree with Dennett that safeguards are indispensable. Requiring disclosure through watermarking or provenance systems, coupled with regulatory oversight and accountability for misuse, would help preserve trust in democratic systems. In addition, building a culture that discourages undisclosed impersonation ensures that the “intentional stance” does not become a liability. Consequently, AI should be viewed not as counterfeit humanity but as a culmination of human progress: an innovation that, when responsibly managed, has the capacity to strengthen rather than weaken society.

In his article, philosopher Daniel Dennett warns about what he sees as one of the gravest threats to our society - the rise of "counterfeit people" made possible with the breakthrough development in artificial intelligence (AI). He opens with a comparison to counterfeit money, which has been treated as a serious crime since inception since it breaks trust between people, undermining business activities and social developments as a whole. He argues that AI, or "counterfeit people", poses the same threats to society, risking the democracy and personal freedom that took humans a long time to get to in civilization. Near the end, Dennett argues that counterfeit people should be traceable, with possibilities to impose penalities on those who abuses it, since it threatens our civilization.

Dennett traces the roots of the problem to Turing's idea in 1950 called "imitation game", which is now known as the Turing Test. This reference later turns out to have funneled scientists into building machines which would mimick human behavior so closely that they could basically fool us as being "human." Since I read Dennett's pieces in high school on the mind, I know Dennett places heavy emphasis on what defines the mind, or a person. Here, Dennett claims that humans are prone to treating anything that talks alike to themselves to be a "human."

Nevertheless, Dennett doesn't just only criticize AI. He offers a possible solution - requiring all AI players to dislocse themselves as being "counterfeit." This could be achieved by imposing watermarking similar to how the European Union put watermarking on their currency. Dennett emphasized that humans behind these counterfeit human should be personally liable, to a very great extent, to deter any potential harm that may arise from AI. 

Lastly, Dennett thinks tracing AI and imposing accountability isn't enough to counter these counterfeit humans. He calls for a even greater response - a total culture shift, where society treats the creation of AI as shameful and dangerous. He says that without responding swiftly, society may really be facing a greater risk of distrust that could topple the very systems keeping our freedom alive.

Personally, I think Dennett is a little too paranoid about AI development. During high school, I read his works in AP English Language Composition, where I learned about the "intentional stance" he talked about. Here, Dennett argues that the way AI outputs naturally tricks humans into attributing it as a human when it is not. While this is valid to a certain degree, I don't think this negatively affects civilization at all. I use AI on a daily basis, and my experience is that it has improved my life a lot. Sure, AI-generated images are not too pleasant to the eye. But having AI to summarize things, take meeting notes, look up for any trivial things online, I believe it is truly a convenience to have.

The very nature of generative AI is that it is trained on the very civizliation and knowledge that humans have built up, particularly from the past century or so. It is the culmination of civilization, not the destruction of such. It simply optimizes our everyday processes. I would think of AI as an advanced calculator with a more human "wrapper" to interact with easier. In my opinion, Dennett thinks too fragile of the human kind. Behind all AI interactions, we still recognize that the subject they serve is human. AIs are merely agents to support humans.

I do agree with the proposal of an AI watermarking program. Getting legislature to act in the creation of responsible AI is important. Once the foundation is supervised and well-maintained, I believe usage comes out to be no problem, and abuse would also disappear.

*3rd Commit: ChatGPT involved to improve grammar*
Your draft is clear and well-structured! The grammar is mostly correct, but there are a few places where the flow, word choice, and verb forms could be polished. Below I’ll give you sentence-level corrections and then a cleaned-up version of your essay.

🔧 Suggested Grammar & Style Fixes

"since inception since it breaks trust" → change to “since its inception, as it breaks trust…”

"possibilities to impose penalities on those who abuses it" → “possibilities to impose penalties on those who abuse it”

"machines which would mimick" → “machines that would mimic”

"to be a 'human.'" → “as ‘human.’”

"dislocse" → “disclose”

"humans behind these counterfeit human" → “humans behind these counterfeit people”

"to a very great extent" → better as “to a significant extent”

"calls for a even greater response" → “calls for an even greater response”

"I use AI on a daily basis, and my experience is that it has improved my life a lot." → smoother as “I use AI daily, and it has greatly improved my life.”

"look up for any trivial things online" → “look up trivial things online”

"the very civizliation and knowledge" → “the very civilization and knowledge”

"particularly from the past century or so" → can be shortened to “particularly over the past century”

"Dennett thinks too fragile of the human kind" → awkward → “Dennett underestimates the resilience of humanity”

"Behind all AI interactions, we still recognize that the subject they serve is human." → smoother as “Behind every AI interaction, we still recognize that the ultimate subject it serves is human.”

🔧 Instructions for Revision
1. Structure

Divide clearly into summary (Dennett’s argument) and commentary (your evaluation). Right now they’re blended. Professors typically expect a clear distinction.

Use transition phrases: “Dennett first argues…,” “In addition…,” “Finally…,” for summary; “From my perspective…,” “However…,” “Nevertheless…” for commentary.

2. Tone

Replace informal/casual phrases with academic equivalents:

“Dennett is a little too paranoid” → “Dennett’s argument may reflect an overly cautious perspective.”

“AI-generated images are not too pleasant to the eye” → “AI-generated images often lack aesthetic refinement.”

“I use AI daily, and it has greatly improved my life” → “My own experience suggests that AI has meaningfully enhanced productivity and efficiency.”

3. Precision & Word Choice

Use consistent verbs like argues, asserts, contends, maintains instead of says, thinks.

Replace vague terms like “stuff” or “things” with more precise nouns (e.g., “tasks,” “applications,” “technologies”).

Fix small grammar errors: “penalities” → “penalties”; “fover” → “over.”

4. Academic Objectivity

Acknowledge counterarguments with balance. Instead of dismissing Dennett, frame critique diplomatically:

“Dennett underestimates the resilience of humanity” → “Dennett may underappreciate the degree to which human society adapts to technological change.”

5. Cohesion

Use linking sentences between summary and commentary: e.g., “While Dennett emphasizes cultural dangers, my own perspective emphasizes the practical benefits AI brings to daily life.”

6. Closing

End with a thoughtful synthesis: tie together Dennett’s warnings, your perspective, and the broader societal implications. Don’t stop abruptly at “abuse would be minimized.” End with a sentence that looks forward.


"abuse would also disappear" → better as “abuse would be minimized” (since “disappear” is too absolute).

*6th Commit: Improving commentary*
Got it — I’ll keep your summary section unchanged (since it’s already clear and strong), and focus on restructuring and polishing your commentary section for flow, word choice, and academic tone.

Here’s what I’ve done in the improved version:

Added a clear thesis sentence at the start of your commentary.

Split your thoughts into agreement vs. disagreement paragraphs.

Refined analogies (kept the calculator idea but framed it more academically).

Used more formal transitions (“Granted,” “Even so,” “Consequently”).

Tightened word choice (e.g., “unduly pessimistic” instead of “excessively pessimistic”).

Ended with a conditional optimism conclusion that ties your perspective together.
